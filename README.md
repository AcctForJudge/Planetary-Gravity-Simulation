### Gravity Simulation
Simulating planetary motion using `F = Gm1m2/(r^2)`. Each body has its own mass and initial velocity which are used to calculate the gravitational pull it feels from other bodies.

## Controls
WASD - movement in 4 directions
Spacebar - going up
Shift - gowing down
P - play/pause
H - show/hide orbits

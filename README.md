### Gravity Simulation
Simulating planetary motion using `F = Gm1m2/(r^2)`. Each body has its own mass and initial velocity which are used to calculate the gravitational pull it feels from other bodies.

### Controls
1. WASD - movement in 4 directions
2. Spacebar - going up
3. Shift - gowing down
4. P - play/pause
5. 
H - show/hide orbits
